# Schemas

This folder holds OpenAPI documents used for command generation.

Sample OpenAPI specs live under `schemas/samples/` and are used by the registry
build script during development. Drop additional `.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml`
files into that directory to include them in the manifest build.

Legacy Heroku schemas have been moved to `legacy/`.
